# **Creating a quiz game**

## Quiz Game

#### This is a Python program that simulates a quiz game with 12 questions. The program uses a Question class to store the question text and answer, and a Brain class to handle the game logic.

## Installation
#### To run the program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage
#### The program will prompt you to enter the number of players and then ask you to answer each question. The program will display whether the answer is correct or incorrect, and keep track of the scores for each player. At the end of the game, the program will print out the player with the highest score and their name.
